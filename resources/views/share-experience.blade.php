                        <p>There’s often a stigma around <span>tourism</span>, most people will say that you should try
                            and see all
                            the
                            famous places, but that’s not always the goal. It can be so much more than just doing the
                            rounds
                            at some favorite tourist spots, especially if you’re one of those <span> backpackers</span>
                            who’s looking
                            for a
                            full-fledged adventure. Taking a trip should be a fulfilling activity, not a generic trail
                            of footsteps
                            that you’re expected to follow. At first, going from one place to another may seem like a
                            hassle
                            without those footsteps to track, but we can help you with that</p>
                        <p>Founded in 2022, iVacay is a “one-of-a-kind” travel website that strives to become the <span>
                                travel center of America</span> in the long run.</p>
                        <p>Here at iVacay, we believe that every one of your <span>vacations</span> should be a unique

                            experience that will stay with you forever. You deserve to not worry about anything other
                            than
                            what to pack in your <span>suitcases—</span> and that should be your standard.
